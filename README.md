# Goals

## Learning

### Compiler design
By programming a compiler you can learn about of its  **core components (lexer, parser, code generator etc.)**.
This will be an interesting project to build if you love low-level programming.

### Algorithms & Data structures

All the **algorithms and data structures** will be implemented from scratch. So we will learn quite a lot about that too.


### Conclusion
As a result of this project, we will hopefully have a working compiler, like gcc, but probably much simpler. 

Overall, this is mostly for learning purposes and I will do my best to provide documentation as detailed & easy to understand as I can, so, **feel free to contribute**.
